Game rules: 1000 pts to win. Get silver or gold coins to receive 20 pts each and +1 HP
from the latter coin. For every HP over 3, which is the default, the player gets a 
lazer to shoot. The lazer can be used to kill multiple enemy ships, get multiple silver 
and/or gold coins with one well aligned shot. But you lose 1 HP for each lazer you shoot 
but you won't get down after 3 HP
